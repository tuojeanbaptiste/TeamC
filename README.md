At Wilmington University, students have the opportunity to pursue a career and become a leader. It’s not just about meeting your potential, it’s about exceeding it.

Wilmington University is a private, non-sectarian university which offers both undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of career areas. The University began with a charter class of 194 students in 1968 and now enrolls a diverse student body numbering more than 18,000 annually.

The program of day, evening, and weekend classes serves traditional high school graduates as well as non-traditional adult students in need of flexible scheduling. Classes are primarily offered in 15-week, 7-week, and weekend modular formats. Introduced in 2005, Fusion programs combine online and face-to-face learning. These programs are designed for students who wish to complete their degree in less time than is possible with traditional courses.

Wilmington University’s main campus is located near the cities of Wilmington and historic New Castle, Delaware. The campus is easily accessible by air, rail, and bus. Our central location in the northeast/mid-Atlantic corridor of the United States provides students convenient access to the major cities of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. Recreational areas such as beaches and ski resorts are within easy driving distance.

Additional sites include the Wilson Graduate Center, Dover, Dover Air Force Base, the William A. Carter Partnership Center in Georgetown, and Brandywine. In New Jersey, Wilmington University offers programs on the Burlington County College and Cumberland County College campuses, and the Joint Base Education Center for McGuire AFB/Fort Dix/Lakehurst Naval Air Station.

Wilmington University generally serves commuter students and does not provide student housing facilities. However, the University welcomes all qualified students and assists those needing living accommodations by providing a listing of nearby rental opportunities.
