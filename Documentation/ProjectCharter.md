**Project overview**

**Background**

Wilmington University is a private, non-profit, doctoral research institution with its main campus located in New Castle, Delaware, United States.

Wilmington University was founded in 1968 as Wilmington College by educator Dr. Donald Ross. It officially became Wilmington University in 2007. As of 2016, the university serves a total student body of 20,522 undergraduate and postgraduate students in nearly 100 degree and certificate programs. The university&#39;s programs are offered at its main campus in historic New Castle as well as at six additional campuses in Delaware.

**Problem Statement**

Every year, thousands of students go through the process of registering for class in order to pursue their interest in Wilmington University. Registration often entails assembling required materials, completing forms, and waiting in line on specific registration days. For students selecting courses, registration may also involve multiple exchanges of paperwork and time spent coordinating schedules with school staff members. We want to simplify these processes at Wilmington University and across all its campuses.

  **Project Vision**

Our research indicates that there are two distinct situations in which students may register with a school: when enrolling for the first time and when selecting classes for each period. The purpose of this system is to allow the enrollment of /existing students and the registration of student for a particular course. It is intended to complete the specifications of what functionality the admission provides and save time for both the admission office and students, reduce the uses of paperwork, ensure data accuracy and security and save money. After the first enrollment, students can register or drop a class within a limited period of time. All information about a student can be accessible in a second.

This system will be beneficial for

| **#** | **Benefited By** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Student – who will use WILMU web page |
| 2 | Admission office – who work with registration and Financial department |
| 3 | University management – Such as student advisors |
| 4 | Teacher – can view courses and student |



**Success Criteria**

The success for this product will be

- Student should be able to login to a web page
- Student should be able to select the course and view related information
- Students should be able to Search for a course
- Student should be able to Register for the course
- Student should be allowed to Register 3 Courses only
- Student should able to get inform about new courses that are offering upcoming semester by (notification capability)
- Stakeholder satisfaction
- Performance of the team
- Quality of the Project
- On time delivery

**Project Approach/Development Process**

We go for an alternative methodology to traditional project management, which promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

To complete our entire project, we divided our project task into four sprints, each sprint has a well define goal, and duration set by the stakeholders. All stakeholders must meet in person to get the feedback on the sprint before we move on to the next sprint, and end of every week our project will review by product owner.

The process will remain the same for each sprint

**Project plan**

Our plan to success this project is follow:

| **Project Plan** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Identify and meet stakeholders | Identifying write requirement is important |
| Set Goals | Set the project goals and prioritize them by the importance |
| Define roles and responsibilities | The team needs to participate in the development of many aspects of the plan based on their responsibility |
| Project schedule | Create Project Schedule by availability of the team member |
| Identify issues and  the risk  assessment | Identify the difficulties and the quickest to manage the work flow |
| Communicate | Communicate regularly to get update about project increment |

**Scope**

_Home_ page component

This is the graphical page, which will be user friendly, easy to understand, and provide minimum required information.

_Login and Authentication component_

This is the interface that allows authenticate users to login to the system. This will guide user to the relevant home page.

_Student component_

Student Select Subjects: This interface will provide the available subject list for the semester. This allows the student to choose the subjects, hence a busy interface. This interface is the bridge between the student component and the subject component.

Student Profile: This interface is used for the student to view and edit personnel information.

_Subject component_

New Subject: This interface is where administrator adds new subjects to the courses offered. The Subject and student components are connected. Edit Subject: In this interface the administrator edits existing subjects. The Subject and student components are connected so that student can select subjects from the available subject list.

**In Scope**

| **Release** | **Priority** | **Story** | **Story Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home Page | Easy to use | Natalia C | Smart Web Page | Make easy to understand for new and existing users |
| Login | Security   | Sanjoy G |  Authentication system | Use security id and password that one users cannot access other users account and personal information   |
| Users Account | Able to view status | Shanker K |  Student Profile | student can create their own profile |
| Student Component | Able to view required and reaming course | Nidhi J |  Students Registration | Users can view, and select between required courses   |
| Subject component | Add Subject | Sanjoy G | Add and Withdraw Subject | Administrator will be able to add new subject offering |

This project scope provides an overview of the user stories that the project is going to deliver. Scope might be subdivided into the scope of the initial product release and planned growth strategies for subsequent releases, they are; #Release #Priority #Story # Story Name #Description
